# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Import the math module to use the built-in functions for calculation
### Step 2: 
Take two lists containing the points as the element
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the distance with two decimal places
### Step 5:
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x1=4
y1=2
x2=10
y2=6
distance = math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```  


### OUTPUT:
